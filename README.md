## Introduction
Built using HTML CSS & Javascript, this website uses the OMDB API to create a movie/series search. Functionalities include user input for movie/title search and filtering titles using date and content type. 

An initial search will show all titles that match the user specified title on the left-hand column, while selecting one of these entries will display the full details for the title in the main (RHS) section of this display. 

### Technologies
HTML, CSS & Javascript

### Usage
Users begin typing in the top-left search bar to begin searching for titles. The left hand column will show the initial search result titles and year that match the user specified input. Selecting one of these titles from the colum will display the full details for the title in the main (RHS) section, with information such as year of release, rating, genre, runtime, cast, plot summary and reviews.
